    	<h2> Steps </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Drain the bulgar wheat. The bulgar should be soft when ready. Peel and quarter the onion.</li>
        <li>Split the meat into three batches. Ground the first two in a food processor and place them in
         a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Put the third batch in the food processor along with the raw onion and spices and process. 
          Add this onion mixture to the rest of the ground meat.</li>
        <li>Add the bulgur to the meat and start kneading the mixture with your hands until everything is
         mixed together (it takes around 5-7 minutes so keep mixing). If you feel the mixture needs it,
          place your hands in a bowl of cold water and then mix again. </li>
        <li>Once everything is combined, shape the mixture into a large ball. Move it to the serving dish
         and start patting it down until it covers the entire serving plate. </li>
        <li>Use a fork to make lines across the kibbeh nayeh. </li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil. Decorate with greens or mint. </li>
